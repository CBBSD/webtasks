        <p>The history of the X5 begins in 1994, when ideas began on a BMW sports utility vehicle after the acquisition of Land Rover. Eduard Walek was named project leader and chief engineer of the E53. Chris Chapman joined BMW Group's Designworks in California later and began working with Bangle in Munich on two full-scale clay models of the E53 for two months. By the autumn of 1996, design work was approved and the design basis for the X5 (E53) was defined, 35 months prior to production. After supplier and engineering involvement, the final design freeze was reached in the first half of 1997, with prototypes being tested from the second half of 1997. </p>

        <p>The Porsche Cayenne entered the market with mixed anticipation. However, it soon proved that it was the performance vehicle among SUVs and was praised for its excellent handling and powerful engines. The lineup initially consisted of the V8-powered Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo. Later in the model cycle, VR6 and diesel-powered versions joined the lineup.
        The base model is powered by a 3.2-L VR6 engine producing 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp); modifications in the exhaust manifold allow power to peak at 6,700 rpm. Acceleration from 0â€“60 mph (97 km/h) is approx 7.5 seconds with the manual transmission and 8.1 seconds with the Tiptronic S.</p>
